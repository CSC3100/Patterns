## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug in the code examples, please:
1. Check if the issue has already been reported.
2. If not, open a new issue and provide a clear description of the problem.
3. Include steps to reproduce the bug, if applicable.

### Submitting Code
When contributing code:
1. Ensure your code is well-documented.
2. Include unit tests if applicable.
3. Follow the project's [Style Guide](#style-guide).
4. Include a descriptive commit message.
5. Ensure that your code passes all tests and linter checks before submitting a pull request.

### Writing Documentation
Good documentation is crucial. You can contribute by:

2. Improving existing documentation for clarity and completeness.

### Improving Examples
Enhancements to existing examples or new examples on diverse topics are welcome. Examples might include:
1. Implementing design patterns.
2. Showcasing algorithms and data structures.
3. Demonstrating software development best practices.
4. Illustrating concepts from software engineering, such as Agile methodologies, unit testing, or code refactoring.

## Style Guide
To maintain consistency and readability across the codebase:
1. Follow the language-specific guidelines.
   - For Java:
     - Use the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
     - Document each class with Javadoc, including the `@author` tag with your name.
   - For other languages:
     - Follow widely accepted style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).
2. Write meaningful and descriptive commit messages.
3. Keep functions and methods short and focused.
4. Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.
